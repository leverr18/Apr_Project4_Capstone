Data Bootcamp Week 23 Capstone Project
This project is the final capstone for our data science bootcamp. We analyze and visualize data from Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, MA using a dataset from Kaggle. Our goal is to uncover pricing differences, trip duration patterns, and demand trends between the two ride-sharing services.

## 📊 Project Overview
The main objectives of this analysis are:

Fare Comparison: Determine which ride-sharing service—Uber or Lyft—offers lower fares across various ride types and distance ranges.

Trip Duration Analysis: Explore how trip duration varies with distance, ride type, and service provider.

Demand Trends: Identify patterns in ride demand based on time of day, day of the week, and ride type.
